# Scores Display

An early stage of an app to display match scores of Dickinson men's tennis team. The release of the app was delayed due to the outbreak. I anticipate to publish it by the start of the fall season. App is developed using React Native and Expo CLI

To start the app use `expo start`

Scores Display uses a custom Express API to connect to MongoDB.  https://github.com/sorkinl/Scores-server
