  /*
  Add an image of a player as a prop when styling
  TODO: Leo - I have 2 working components here and we can add their props into onSubmit as destructured object.
  But for know coach will be able to add unlimited amount of matches, because I don't have an ID.
  We have a choice to add ID to each player, that way more than one player with same ID cannot exist. Or we 
  can add id to a separate match component which will make more sense, but I have no idea
  how that will work.
  We could possibly add 2 players to Match component and then make a callback function to OnSubmit to 
  get the props from the players. Then pass an ID with the Match component to flatlist. I think that's the 
  best way.
